AI Powered Deadlock Detection System
 Features
🔍 Automatic Deadlock Detection: Scans system states to detect potential or existing deadlocks.

🤖 AI-Driven Analysis: Uses Machine Learning models (e.g., GNNs or RNNs) to learn locking patterns and predict deadlock-prone scenarios.

📈 Real-time Monitoring: Continuously monitors thread and process behaviors to detect anomalies.

⚠️ Deadlock Resolution Suggestions: Recommends optimal process killing, rollback, or resource preemption strategies.

📊 Visual Dashboard: Interactive web UI for visualizing resource allocation graphs and deadlock risks.

🔒 Safe & Scalable: Designed for integration in large-scale distributed and multithreaded environments.
